        <p>Developed and Deployed a blog posting site from scratch featured with the blogging service, user authentication, weather report, news, and geolocation coordinate system that streams data over the globe and broadcast news in a more timely manner,
            programmed the system in such a way that whenever the unidentified user trying to breach security, the device will automatically send an email and sms notification! By building this project i have learnt about:

        <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
        <p>Many PHP developers need to send email from their code. The only PHP function that supports this is mail(). However, it does not provide any assistance for making use of popular features such as encryption, authentication, HTML messages, and attachments.
            So I developed a PHP Mailer System using PHPMailer library, which is embedded in a web application used to send emails safely and easily via PHP code from a web server.</p>

        <div class="subheading mb-3"></div>
        <p>A word search is a puzzle that uses words and puts them in a grid. The point of the game is to find all of the words hidden in the grid. The puzzle consists of a grid of letters that is usually a rectangle or square shape, but different shapes
            are possible, some that even look like an object like a plant or animal. Besides the grid is a list of words. The letters in the word appear in order somewhere in the grid, and can be placed horizontally, vertically or diagonally. A letter
            in the grid can be used in more than one word, and not all the letters in the grid have to appear in a word. To solve the puzzle, a person has to find the place where each word is hidden in the grid, and when he or she finds that place, he
            or she circles all the letters in the word (as shown in the example), and then crosses the word off the list so that he or she knows not to look for that word again. It is easier to find the bigger words first since they have more letters.</p>
