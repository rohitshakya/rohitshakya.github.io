# Multiple CRM Projects – 5 Years of Architecture & Development

Over the span of **5+ years**, I contributed to and led backend development for multiple **Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** platforms across **healthtech, e-commerce, and operational workflow automation**.  
These CRMs enabled scalable internal operations, customer support automation, workflow orchestration, and real-time data visibility for thousands of daily users.

Each CRM was built with modular, service-oriented backend architecture and integrated deeply with customer apps, operations tools, and external partners.
